Hi, Iâ€™m Dreysion. I've always wanted to build video games, and so started teaching myself to code in high school. I started with HTML/JavaScript and played a bit with C, C++, and Batch. Now I'm working more with Godot and Python, and still using JavaScript a lot.

I have way too many ideas, and I have a tendency to keep making them bigger and better (to a fault). Currently trying to build up the motivation to consistently work on things. 

I'm using Github Pages to let other people play my games, and I'm also using it as a reference spot so people can see how to do certain things with code (although since I'm self-taught, there's always the fear I don't follow standard practices). I'll eventually start a Youtube channel or something too. I'll link it here when I've gotten into a decent enough rhythm creating and posting videos.

I'm not currently trying to get people to follow me, but you're welcome to if you like. I feel like I need to have some things built before I start seriously showing it off, you know?

I'll update here too as I make progress.

P.S. Don't look at my site, I haven't put any work into it yet!
