Hi, Iâ€™m Dreysion. I'm completely self-taught at coding in general, and now starting to get into Big Data too. I have way too many ideas, and I have a tendency to keep making them bigger and better (to a fault). Currently trying to build up the motivation to consistently work on things. 

Currently my main focus on GitHub is for creating video games. Maybe I'll eventually start a Youtube channel or something too.

I'm not currently trying to get people to follow me, but you're welcome to if you like. I feel like I need to have something built before I start showing it off, you know?

I'll update here too as I make progress.
